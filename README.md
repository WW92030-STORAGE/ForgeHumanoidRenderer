# ForgeHumanoidRenderer
- Humanoid mob rendering template for Minecraft Forge. The entity in this case is named DARKNESS but can be changed freely. 
- You can potentially generalize this to other entities that use premade models.

# FILES

- HumanoidRenderer.java - Sets up a renderer for mobs with the player model.
- OTHERSTUFF.TXT - Small snippets you need in other places to get the thing working. Also includes some other reference materials.

# CREDITS

Renderer based on TFGiantRenderer from Twilight Forest. Most other things based on Kaupenjoe's tutorial series.
